#while loop can be repeted forever, for loop need to know how many time you want to repeat your loop!
for i in range(100,10,-5):
  print(f"{i}")
  #range function is only 3 numbers (first is START number, second is FINISH number and third is STEP number(o ile sie przesowa, by default is always one, but we can change it to 2,3,4itp..czyli nasze liczenie bedzie sie przesowac np o 2 albo o 3 steps. You can have a negative steps as well! ))
