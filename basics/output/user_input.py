#[Story]
#Beep finds itself in a large workshop. It is feeling afraid and confused. It does not know where it is. Beep will need reassuring to help it settle into its new environment.Let us consider a simple example where we wish to create a program to represent the communication between Beep and us. The program should display a simple message "What is your name human?".  The program should then read in the user's response and subsequently display an appropriate confirmation message.

print("What is your name human?")
name=input()
print("It is nice to meet you human", name)
