#We have thus far learnt that the print function can be used to output text to the screen. Often, we would like to have more control over how text is displayed. There are a number of ways to do this but one approach is to use special character sequences known as escape characters. These sequences consist of two or more characters and begin with a back slash (\).


#Display escape characters
print("\n Displays a new line")
print("\t Displays a tab space")
print("\\ Displays a back slash")
print("\" Displays a double quote)
print("\' Displays a single quote'")
print("I am beep!")
